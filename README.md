# Curated Networking Resources for UNIX/Linux

Here’s a curated list of practical, in-depth, and mostly free resources to help you master networking under the hood on UNIX/Linux systems:

## 📘 Foundational Understanding

- **The Linux Documentation Project – Networking Guide**  
  Covers core network setup, IP routing, DNS, and more.

- **Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice (Free Book)**  
  A university-grade textbook with real-world protocol explanations and TCP/IP stack deep dives.

- **Beej’s Guide to Network Programming**  
  The holy grail of socket programming — approachable, detailed, and full of C code examples.

## 🧪 Hands-On Learning

- **Linux Foundation Networking Tutorials**  
  Especially helpful for understanding how Linux handles interfaces, DHCP, DNS, etc.

- **NixCraft Networking Commands Cheatsheet**  
  Quickly reference ip, ss, netstat, nmap, and other CLI tools.

- **IP Networking with Wireshark**  
  Use Packet Tracer or Wireshark to visualize traffic—ideal for TCP, ARP, DNS, etc.

## 🎥 YouTube Series / Visual Guides

- **Computerphile – Networking Playlist**  
  Entertaining and technical breakdowns of packets, protocols, and layers.

- **NetworkChuck – TCP/IP for Hackers**  
  Applies UNIX networking to ethical hacking & server work.

## 🛠️ Projects & Practice

- **Wireshark Labs**  
  Official lab exercises to practice packet analysis (ARP, TCP handshake, DNS).

- **Linux Networking Exercises (Princeton)**  
  Great intro + real commands with lab setup.

- **GitHub – Awesome Networking**  
  Curated repo of tools, protocols, theory, and implementations.

## 🧠 Advanced Deep Dives

- **UNIX Network Programming by W. Richard Stevens**  
  The Bible of UNIX sockets, TCP internals, and client-server design (paid, but worth every cent).

- **Linux Kernel Networking by Rami Rosen**  
  For digging into the source code that runs the stack itself.
